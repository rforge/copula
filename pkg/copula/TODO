##-*- org -*-->  Emacs .. [Tab] key + [Org] menu; C-c C-o to follow links
* Short Term (before 1.0.0):
** TODO [MM/JY]: Add slot 'fixed' (or similar) to copula class, change constructors of existing classes accordingly and make appropriate changes in fitCopula() (and gofCopula() if required and do basic checks)
** TODO [JY]: once 'fixed' stuff added, rewrite/adapt tCopula, tevCopula (so that the 'df.fixed' stuff uses the new 'fixed' stuff) ?
** TODO need a "getTheta" analogously to "setTheta"
which extracts the parameter (vector) from any copula object
** TODO Clarify C.n() argument issues
     - most likely, we should rename 'X' to 'data' (as is used often; sometimes
       not, though (like gofCopula()) => but clarify)
     - the same probably applies to dCn()
** TODO [MM] copula@fullname: is used in print() method; Want also use for plotting -- hence urgent for book!
- want to use "it" by default, e.g.,  `main = copula@fullname` in persp() etc, *HOWEVER*
  it is too long / ugly, e.g.,  "Gumbel copula family; Archimedean copula; Extreme value copula"
  contains "copula" *3* times !
** TODO [MM] Is it possible to generate (inheritance) tree class structure with methods automatically from the code ?
** TODO rhoTCopula not valid! => should define rho* and irho* only for Gauss copula!
** TODO [JY] Clean-up/document "old" copula files (such as ellip*/archm*/ev* copula files); write documentation a la 'Marius' (with Roxygen)
** TODO [JY] Check appropriate position of methods in classes
** TODO ~/R/MM/Pkg-ex/maryamS-ex.R : negative correlation data has BAD error message
 now see FIXME in   tests/fitting-ex.R  'msg <-
 tryCatch(fitCopula(gumbelCopula(), ....'
** TODO Make absdPsi() work for class archmCopula() using nacopula stuff (see TODO ub dC-dc.R)
** TODO Figure out and document somewhere how much objects of class archmCopula already use the good old nacopula stuff
- fitCopula() -> loglikCopula() always uses the nacopula slots [all of the 5 AC families in R/fitCopula.R]
** TODO Make more archmCopula stuff use acopula stuff (like pK() doesn't work for archmCopulas!! => we should really have all functionality of acopulas used by archmCopulas! so much 'overhead')
*** TODO rCopula() for archmCopula's should allow to use MH's racopula()
*but* for back compatibility allow *global* options(....) to still get old
random numbers.
*** TODO The NAC Archimedean families are partly 'better' and partly "worse" than archmCop: need 'uscore'
*** TODO JY: For score & uscore (see [[file:feature-table.org][Feature table]]); write testing code
based on IJ-"papers" that compares the two classes numerically.
*** TODO d=2 is special: allows negative tau, MH-code now does partly.
 done for Clayton, Frank, AMH.  BUT not for the R/cop_objects.R slots
*** DONE MM: pCopula(<archm>) and dCopula(<archm>)
use the the numerically good formulae rather than the "exprDist".
** TODO [MM + MH] implement fitting of NACs with fixed structure (how is it done in the R package 'HAC'?)
** TODO [MM + MH] function(outer_nacopula) -> matrix of 'comp' (in {1:d})
which corresponds to the different sectors.
This can be used, e.g., for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or
for estimation purposes etc. Note: look at nacPairthetas
** TODO Shall fitCopula.ml(, method="mpl") call pobs()?
MH:
At the moment, fitCopula.ml(, method="mpl") requires data in
[0,1]^d. We could actually allow general data from IR^d for this
method and then internally apply pobs(). The main advantage is that
this would be more fail-safe for users (a user currently gets an error
if the data is not in [0,1]^d, but that doesn't guarantee that the
data are pobs()...). A "technical" drawback is that when called from
gofPB() or gofMB() (time critical), pobs() is called a bit more often
than necessary; however, since we always call fitCopula() with
estimate.variance=FALSE from gofCopula(), it actually makes no sense
to call fitCopula(, "mpl") [although you can choose to do so if you
like] so one could simply call fitCopula(, "ml") then to avoid the
additional pobs() evaluations. One "conceptual" drawback is this: in
the whole file fitCopula.R, we never call pobs() -- it's always left
to the reader. So implementing it in fitCopula.ml(, method="mpl")
would 'contradict' that. Really not sure... I tend to say the
advantage outweighs the drawbacks... What do you think?
** TODO We seem to have quite a few 'deprecated' statements in the package (should be fine to remove some of the old stuff by now!)
** TODO [IK] Improve warning message in dC-dc.R when numerical stuff is used (provide the copula name!)
** TODO [IK] make method = "Rd" work with all the sim = "mult" families
** TODO [IK] clean-up test functions
** TODO [IK] Document dC-dc.R
** TODO [IK] Implement copula rotations (rotCopula()); mostly done incl tests/rotCopula-ex.R
** TODO [IK] Implement copula mixtures (mixCopula()) with sufficiently flexible structure so that we can maybe estimate the probability weights in the future
** TODO [IK/JY] Implement Liebscher copulas (asymCopula()) for 2 'base copulas' (any dimension)
** TODO [JY] document getL() a bit more in fitCopula.R (what is it for?); there's a TODO there as well (in the header of getL())
** TODO introduce "empiricalCopula" (or "empCopula") as new subclass of "Copula" (not "copula")
   and maybe *additionally* "empiricalDist" / "empMvdc", inheriting from
   new "Mvdc" which would contain "mvdc" and "empMvdc".
   -> nice persp() {and maybe contour()} method via perspCopula(*, fun=C.n, ....) and
      perspMvdc(*, fun=F.n, ....). ---> man/Mvdc.Rd and R/graphics.R
** TODO [MM] print(summary(<fitCop>)) prints *less* than print(.): not R like; -> R/fitCopula.R summary.fitCopula
** TODO [MM] Shall we make print(fitCopula()) nicer by omitting the (theoretical meaningless) p-values?
** TODO [MM] pCopula(u,..) and dCopula(u,..) should work for u outside [0,1]^d  & NA/NaN
*** TODO both should keep NA & NaN. Maybe keep them different, as  pnorm(c(2,NA,NaN));
however relax, as  NA+NaN or NaN+NA  differ, too.
*** DONE for pCopula(): using  u[] <- pmax(0, pmin(1, u))  {subtlety!}
*** DONE dCopula() = 0 {log = -Inf} for u "outside"
** TODO [MM] why does onacopulaL("Clayton", *) work, but onacopulaL("clayton",*) does not?
Specifically,
   onacopulaL("Clayton", list(th=iTau(archmCopula("clayton"), tau=0.5), seq_len(3)))
works but
   onacopulaL("clayton", list(th=iTau(archmCopula("clayton"), tau=0.5), seq_len(3)))
doesn't.  Note the 2nd  "clayton", i.e. as arg to archmCopula(.) it _does_ work.
 => essentially, we always want to use the capitalized versions, but it might
    still be a bug that it doesn't work otherwise
** TODO [all 4] Renaming of current "base" functions see [[file:feature-table.org][Feature table]] and [[file:do-now.org][do-now table]]
    remaining: lambdaL/U and inverse ("iLambda").
** TODO Deprecation of Old Stuff / towards more consistency / Cleanup
- with warning
- on help pages
*** DONE "copula" class: slot re-definitions
**** DONE 'message' --> 'fullname'
**** no longer TODO: 'param.lowbnd' / 'param.upbnd' --- use "interval" as in nacopula
*** TODO nparam() "wrapper" for  length(.@parameters)
*** no longer TODO: dTau() = tau'(), rho() and dRho() = rho'() -- to get std.err. for  "itau" and "irho"
**** these are *one* of the things where IJ-archmCopula' are better
** TODO Exporting/Documenting of "internal" functions:
*** DONE => C.n(). JY: Ivan, I think we should export an empCopula function. I always
thought it was unnecessary because it can be obtained with R package mecdf.
But people have asked for it.
*** Also, look at ./man/copula-internal.Rd :
*** no longer TODO: schlatherCopula:  JY: The implementation of schlatherCopula is not ready for release.
More ev copulas will come from max-stable processes.
** TODO why not make fitCopula more work like a 'method' (adapt to the copula class in an easier way)
** TODO fitCopula() should encompass all methods of enacopula() (similar to fitCopula.itau.mpl)
** TODO [MM] data(rdj) should have a "Date" in column 1, not a factor !
** TODO [MM + MH] implement estimation of standard error for fitCopula.itau.mpl
** TODO Deprecation of Old Stuff / more consistency / Cleanup
*** TODO loglikCopula() --- try(), hidemessages should "go" eventually
*** TODO varPL(): TODO's there
*** TODO dTau() = tau'() and dRho() = rho'() -- to get S.Err. for  "itau" and "irho"
these are *one* of the things where IJ-archmCopula' are better
*** TODO dAduGalambos() and similar: Use  list() instead of data.frame() as return value  (?)
*** TODO dCdthetaEvCopula() cannot work (as dAdtheta() has no methods) and is used nowhere
** TODO see TODO in R/tCopula.R : npar.ellip() function;-> nparam(); test pos.def.
** TODO tCopula() / normalCopula() allow alternative specification of cor.matrix at least for the "un" dispersion structure
** TODO opower() and GIG --> either produce acopula with parameter *vector*, or
--- maybe in any case ---
produce an object of class 'opacopula' ("outer power Archimedean copula")
which is just 'acopula' with a new show method ("thetabase" at least!),
possibly a new slot ...
Longer term: want to *estimate* those correctly [MLE at least].
** TODO R/fitCopula.R : method="itau" & "irho": parallelize double for-loop in
 fitKendall() & fitSpearman() :  tests/moments.R must
 check that vectorized iTau() and iRho() work for all families
** TODO MM, MH: indepTest()  takes a while {ok}, *BUT* cannot be interrupted (quickly enough)
    - shouldn't it {and all other tests} return a (valid) object of class
    "htest" (maybe "htest" in addition to the specific S3 class)?
    --> we would probably not need extra print() methods, and just use print.htest()
** TODO use sinpi() etc e.g. in R/ellipCopula.R
** DONE New Wrapper functions or rather extending one or the other function names
*** DONE dcopula(), pcopula(), rcopula()  (for "nacopula")
*** DONE dCopula(x, cop), pCopula(x, cop), rCopula(n, cop)  {swapping args for "standard R" usage}
*** DONE d*():  allow  log=TRUE and use that in loglikCopula()
** DONE MMMH: Use new rCopula() in ggraph *instead* of wrappers
** DONE fitCopula("itau") for "tCopula(df.fixed=FALSE)": (and tevCopula?): use itau for P matrix, then ML for df. {see also ggraph.Rnw}
** DONE Ivan: Document xvCopula()
** DONE Ivan: gofCopula(): make sim="mult" work with more families (use numDeriv to get a generic implementation)
** DONE 'hideWarnings' now in fitMvdc(): Not sink(), change it to use suppressWarnings() the same as fitCopula!
** DONE 'hideWarnings' in fitCopula()
- change default to FALSE
- use within fitCopula() instead of fitCopula.ml() and fitCopula.itau.mpl()
- update ?fitCopula (and other locations?) accordingly
** DONE fitCopula() for 2-dim tCopula() *AND* 2-dim tevCopula(); latter clearly fails
** DONE mvdc() -- fitMvdc() and generate data from fit:
 - fitMvdc()@mvdc  must contain the *fitted* parameters, the same as
   fitCopula()@copula does already.
** DONE rPosStable() is "wrong", actually just rstable1() *scaled* unusually
   --> use rstable1() [unless options(..) for back compatibility]
** DONE no longer try() in loglikCopula()
  - "hideWarnings" seems "wrong by design", there.
  - *However* fitCopula() now uses 'hideWarnings' (again): should *not*
    report warnings by default: They are too disturbing for 'Joe Average'
    fitCopula() user.
** DONE tryCatch() in loglikMvdc(), but not longer hideWarnings there.
   OTOH,
** DONE timings() function name -- changed to nacFrail.time()
** DONE 'hideWarnings' now in fitMvdc(): Not sink(), change it to use suppressWarnings() the same as fitCopula!
** DONE timings() function name -- changed to nacFrail.time()
** DONE setTheta() bug: see tests/fitting-ex.R ..seed(17)
** DONE stopifnot(ncol(u) == (d <- copula@dimension))  *not* ok:
stopifnot(NULL == 1) is not stopping
** DONE matrix(x, ncol=.) is really slower than rbind(x, deparse.level=0L)
** DONE implement uscore for MMMH's A, C, F, G, J (note MH: haven't done any testing)
** DONE MH: in man/empcop.Rd, document 'method' "C"/"R"
** DONE frankCopula(0) and similar should create indepCopula(), and hence work in all cases.
 We have new argument 'use.indepC'
 E-mail From Benedikt Gräler, Subject: frankCopula(0), Fri, 26 Apr 2013:
 dCopula(c(0.3,0.7), frankCopula(0))  gives NaN   but should not
** DONE largely improve on gofTests.R: should be made more modular, so that users can provide functions for the parametric bootstrap (gofPB) and the multiplier boostrap (gofMB). Furthermore, checking and documentation have to be improved (see already improved gofPB());
** DONE deprecate gnacopula() [see 'Note' there!!!]
 MH: already 'prepared' a lot; only difficulty: many calls of gnacopula()
 => ideally, the checks should be done with gofCopula() instead of gnacopula()!!!!
** DONE persp(), contour() should work with pCopula / dCopula.
** DONE getAcop(gumbelCopula()) should work
 => we could then write general methods for all Archimedean objects.
Possible problem (for now): negative concordance case for AMH, Clayton, and Frank
** DONE (MH) LICENCE etc
CLOSED: [2012-07-17 Tue 11:25]
MM: Einstein's rule: Keep it as simple as possible (but not simpler)
All the Copyright headers in R/*.R  src/*.c etc need to be streamlined;
typically containing all 4 names.
MH: I can do that (once Ivan and Jun agree)
JY: I agree
IK: Me too
=> MH: done on 2012-03-25 (for simplicity, I used "2012" everywhere)
** DONE show(<mvdc>) method needed; otherwise printing mvdc(.) looks ugly.
** DONE MM: former nacopula  c_longNames etc  --> rename to .ac_longNames *and* export
  (ac = Archimedean copula)
** DONE New (Super)classes for "merging the class structure"
- new class "Copula" := {copula, nacopula}
** DONE C code
*** DONE [src/init.c] enable registration for the old 'copula' part
*** DONE JY: gsl - Debye ===> Should use them and then *not* carry gsl-source code anymore.
*** DONE IK: in all *.c files from former copula: use Doxygen
instead of hand made function header documentation.
** DONE tests/pdf.R should use "all" copulas, similar to tests/moments.R.
*** DONE Then, test that  exp(dCopula(*, log=TRUE)) "==" dCopula(*)
{to test the bug, fixed in r954, reported by Benedikt}
** DONE ~/R/Pkgs/copula : need a version with much shorter tests on CRAN?
*** can we "not rebuild the PDFs" for the vignettes? to save a bit?

** DONE Use much faster kendall's tau (instead of cor(*, method="kendall")
* Mid Term
** TODO Extend polynEval() with the methods of polyJ();
 this can be called from polyJ() and uscore of Joe.
** TODO Write a function "checkTheta" or "thetaConstr"(param_vector, Copula): checks if the parameters are all admissible.
** TODO iTau(): must use tau.checker() [R/estimation.R]
** TODO t / normal : allow  "block" dispersion structure {including  fitCopula() working}

**** --> e-mail and example: /u/maechler/R/MM/Pkg-ex/copula/mvdc-ex.R
** TODO pCopula() should also accept a 'log.p = FALSE' argument
 and provide more accurate results in the lower tail for log.p=TRUE.
** TODO nice little function that provides confidence intervals for tau and lambda's (from \theta_{MLE})
** TODO [IK] d-dimensional versions of rank-based estimators of the Pickands dependence function
** TODO evTestA(), evTestC(), evTestK() have basically no tests {but improvable code}
 [[file:man/evTestA.Rd][evTestA.Rd]], [[file:man/evTestC.Rd][evTestC.Rd]], [[file:man/evTestK.Rd][evTestK.Rd]
** TODO Testing: ./tests/  must grow, notably for "Jun-Ivan functions"
maybe take ./tests/copula-play.R as sophisticated role model.
** TODO Documentation etc
*** DONE inst/doc/nacopula-pkg.Rnw  -- keep file name, maybe rewrite including
 *Title*  (s/nacopula package/Nested Archimedean Copulas in the copula package/)
*** TODO \link{} between old-copula and old-nacopula  functionality
*** TODO small vignette with table of function names providing the same functionality (nacopula / old_copula)
*** DONE (MH) fixed long lines in all .Rd
** TODO C code
*** DONE [src/init.c] enable registration for the old 'copula' part
*** TODO use 'static' "everywhere" +  attribute_hidden "otherwise"/sometimes
** DONE (MH) rtrafo() {and probably htrafo()} --- "fail" (are *wrong*!) for n = 1
** DONE (MH) copFrank@psi(1/1e20, theta=200) == Inf instead of 1
** DONE rtrafo() is now "available" for "t" and "normal" thanks to the Master thesis of Yongsheng Wang.  (--> ...../function-gof.R )
** DONE MH: @ Jun, Ivan: file R/E.R  only defines E <- exp(1). Reason(MM): work around silly 'CMD check' warnings.
But we should move that to another R/*.R
** DONE makePosDef() -- think of using a version of sfsmisc::posdefify() or nearPD()
** DONE setTheta(): write methods for "copula"s !
** DONE [MH] something more sophisticated than persp(): lattice's wireframe() is the best I know w.r.t to many things
** DONE Rebuild R-forge structure nacopula -> copula
** DONE R/sysdata.rda:
CLOSED: [2012-07-17 Tue 11:10]
MM, MH: Please tell us more about this,
notably about how it is computed {so it can be recomputed, in case
pspline changes ...}.
JY: Sorry for having to use this. The objects stored here are used to
return Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho and their inverse functions
for copulas for which explicit formulas are not available. We used
simulation over a grid of (possibly transformed) parameter values
and smoothed the results with pspline. Some details can be found
in the appendix of Kojadinovic and Yan (2010, IME). The R scripts
that generated sysdata.rda were moved out of the package source.
We can put them back. The best place is under inst?
=> JY: done on 2012-07-12. The R scripts are under inst/docs/tauRho/.
***  R code for inspection:
 attach("~/R/Pkgs/copula/R/sysdata.rda")
 ls.str(pos=2, all=TRUE)
 ## or even
 print(ls.str(pos=2, all=TRUE), max.level = 3)
** DONE Use  paste0()  where possible in IJ-code
** DONE Replace ccop in ggraph by cCopula
** DONE cacopula(): generalize to elliptical ("and more") -> cCopula(), (<==> rtrafo())
* Long Term (mostly: new copulas/ideas/features)
** TODO Ulf Schepsmeier's email to Marius on 2014-04-23: VineCopulas now has wrappers for 'copula' => Ulf suggested to refer to them / their copulas which are not in our package:
library(copula)
persp(BB1Copula(c(1,1.5)), dCopula, zlim=c(0,10))
persp(surBB1Copula(c(1,1.5)), dCopula, zlim=c(0,10))
persp(r90BB1Copula(c(-1,-1.5)), dCopula, zlim=c(0,10))
persp(r270BB1Copula(c(-1,-1.5)), dCopula, zlim=c(0,10))
** TODO Daniel Alai's email from 2013-10-24 (to MH): implement a new correlation structure "min" (row-wise the same rho)
MH: doesn't seem complicated, but wouldn't feel comfortable to do this since
this is old+stable code from Ivan/Jun
** TODO implement Joe's BB copulas!
** TODO ChiPlot(), KPlot() [in R/graphics.R]: Export and document ?
** TODO copula code which is not used --- moved to ./misc/
MM: the previous file (+directory) names were:
    - R/mult.R
    - src/mult.c
    - src/mygsl_util.c
** TODO C code
*** DONE [src/init.c] enable registration for the old 'copula' part
*** TODO Move  from .C() towards .Call() -- only very long term
JY: Agree. Quite a few them. Can it wait?  MM: Definitely; Actually, I
think it's not worth the effort; particularly now that I've spent all the
effort writing src/init.c for registration of all of the .C(..) routines.

** TODO Miscellaneous functions.
*** TODO include pairwise estimators for nACs
*** TODO add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
dendrogram print()ing.
*** TODO Khoudraji d + p + r (see asymCopula.R)
*** TODO IK: add d-dimensional EV copulas corresponding to max-stable processes and corresponding "composite densities"
