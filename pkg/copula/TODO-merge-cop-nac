##-*- org -*--> use Emacs to view this, and there the [Tab] key + [Org] menu

* LICENCE etc


* R/sysdata.rda : ouah!   Please tell us more about this,
  notably about how it is computed {so it can be recomputed, in case
  pspline changes ...}.
  - Note taken on [2012-02-21 Tue 18:52]

***  R code for inspection:

    attach("~/R/Pkgs/copula/R/sysdata.rda")
    ls.str(pos=2, all=TRUE)
    ## or even
    print(ls.str(pos=2, all=TRUE), max.level = 3)


* copula code which is not used --- moved to ./misc/
** the previous file (+directory) names where:
 - R/mult.R
 - src/mult.c
 - src/mygsl_util.c


* C code
** enable registration for the old 'copula' part
 - quite a bit {see commented part in ./NAMESPACE }
   can we automate ?

** move  from .C() towards .Call()

** gsl - debye ===> Think of  'LinkingTo: gsl' in DESCRIPTION
   and then *not* carry gsl-source code anymore.


** in all *.c files from former copula: use Doxygen instead of hand made
   function header documentation.


* New(?) (Super)classes for "merging the class structure"


* New Wrapper functions
  or rather extending one or the other function names

** distribution/density/ ... functions

** random number generation


* Deprecation of Old Stuff


* Documentation etc

 -  ChangeLog *merge* the two (nacopula + copula2)

 -   inst/doc/nacopula-pkg.Rnw  -- keep file name, but rewrite including
    *Title*  (s/nacopula package/Nested Archimedean Copulas in the copula package/
