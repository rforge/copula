\title{Goodness-of-fit tests for copulas}
\description{
  Goodness-of-fit tests for copulas based on the empirical process
  comparing the empirical copula with a
  parametric estimate of the copula derived under the null hypothesis.
  The test statistic is the Cramer-von Mises functional Sn defined
  in equation (2) of Genest, Remillard and Beaudoin (2009).
  Approximate p-values for the test statistic can be obtained either
  using the \emph{parametric bootstrap} (see the two first
  references) or by means of a fast \emph{multiplier} approach (see the two
  last references).

\usage{
gofCopula(copula, x, N = 1000, method = "mpl",
          simulation = c("pb", "mult"),
          print.every = 100, optim.method = "BFGS")
}

\arguments{
  \item{copula}{ object of class \code{"\linkS4class{copula}"} representing the
    hypothesized copula family.}
  \item{x}{ a data matrix that will be transformed to pseudo-observations. }
  \item{N}{ number of bootstrap or multiplier iterations to be used to
    simulate realizations of the test statistic under the null
    hypothesis.}
  \item{method}{ estimation method to be used to estimate the
    dependence parameter(s); can be either \code{"mpl"}
    (maximum pseudo-likelihood), \code{"itau"} (inversion of
    Kendall's tau) or \code{"irho"} (inversion of Spearman's rho). }
  \item{simulation}{ simulation method for generating realizations
    of the test statistic under the null hypothesis; can be either
    \code{"pb"} (parametric bootstrap) or  \code{"mult"} (multiplier).}
  \item{print.every}{ progress is printed every \code{"print.every"}
    iterations. No progress is printed if it is nonpositive.}
  \item{optim.method}{ the method for \code{\link{optim}()}.}
}
\details{
  If the parametric bootstrap is used, the dependence parameters of
  the hypothesized copula family can be estimated either by maximizing
  the pseudo-likelihood or by inverting Kendall's tau or Spearman's rho.
  If the multiplier is used, any estimation method can be used in the
  bivariate case, but only maximum pseudo-likelihood
  estimation can be used in the multivariate (multiparameter) case.

  For the normal and t copulas, several dependence structures can be
  hypothesized: \code{"ex"} for exchangeable, \code{"ar1"} for AR(1),
  \code{"toep"} for  Toeplitz, and \code{"un"} for unstructured (see
  \code{\link{ellipCopula}}). For the t copula, \code{"df.fixed"} has to
  be set to \code{TRUE}, which implies that the degrees of freedom are
  not considered as a parameter to be estimated.

  Thus far, the multiplier approach is implemented for six copula
  families: the Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Plackett, normal and t.

  %Although the processes involved in the multiplier and the parametric
  %bootstrap-based test are asymptotically equivalent, the finite-sample
  %behavior of the two tests might differ significantly.

\note{
  These tests were derived under the assumption of continuous margins,
  which implies that ties occur with probability zero. The
  presence of ties in the data might substantially affect the
  approximate p-values. One way of dealing with ties was suggested in the
  last reference.
