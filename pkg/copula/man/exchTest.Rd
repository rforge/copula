\title{Test of Exchangeability for a Bivariate Copula}
\description{
  Test for assessing the exchangeability of the underlying
  bivariate copula based on the empirical copula.
  The test statistics are defined in the first two references.
  Approximate p-values for the test statistics are obtained
  by means of a \emph{multiplier} technique.
}
\usage{
exchTest(x, N = 1000, m = 0)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ a data matrix that will be transformed to pseudo-observations.}
  \item{N}{ number of multiplier iterations to be used to
    simulate realizations of the test statistic under the null
    hypothesis.}
  \item{m}{ if \code{m=0}, integration in the Cramér--von Mises
    statistic is carried out with respect to the empirical copula; if
  \code{m > 0}, integration is carried out with respect to the Lebesgue
  measure and \code{m} specifies the size of the integration grid.}
}
\details{
  More details are available in the two first references.
}
\value{
  Returns a list whose attributes are:
  \item{statistic}{ value of the test statistic. }
  \item{p.value}{ corresponding approximate p-value. }

\note{
  This test was derived under the assumption of continuous margins,
  which implies that ties occur with probability zero. The
  presence of ties in the data might substantially affect the
  approximate p-value. One way of dealing with ties was suggested in the
  last reference.
