\title{Bivariate Test of Extreme-Value Dependence Based on Pickands'
  Dependence Function}
\description{
  Test of bivariate extreme-value dependence based on the process
  comparing the empirical copula with a natural nonparametric
  estimator of the unknown copula derived under extreme-value
  dependence. The test statistics are defined in the third reference.
  Approximate p-values for the test statistics are obtained
  by means of a \emph{multiplier} technique.
}
\usage{
evTestA(x, N = 1000, derivatives = "An")
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ a data matrix that will be transformed to pseudo-observations. }
  \item{N}{ number of multiplier iterations to be used to
    simulate realizations of the test statistic under the null
    hypothesis.}
   \item{derivatives}{ specifies how the derivatives of the unknown
    copula are estimated; can be either
    \code{"An"} or \code{"Cn"}. The former gives better results for
    samples smaller than 400 but is slower.}
}
\details{
  More details are available in the third reference.

\note{
  This test was derived under the assumption of continuous margins,
  which implies that ties occur with probability zero. The
  presence of ties in the data might substantially affect the
  approximate p-value. One way of dealing with ties was suggested in the
  last reference.
