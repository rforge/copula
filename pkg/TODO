## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(MH) make opower SMLE faster!
(MH) implement 1st derivative of the log density w.r.t. theta
(MH) implement MC engine for Fisher information
(*) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures

(*) numerous FIXME and TODO in the code
(MM) are the numerical issues for Kendall's tau for the GIG generator [see ./demo] solvable? see the plot of Kendall's tau there.
(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?

(MM) is the new splom2 function in graphics.R okay? I implemented two color features
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of numbers 
    which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g., for building 
    a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.
(MM) maybe also update splomFOO. What was this function for again? [we do not use it]
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.
(MM) dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
