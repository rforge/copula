## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(*) make polyG, polyG2, and polyJ more efficient! [see FIXME's]
(*) make pnacopula applicable to a matrix to be consistent with dnacopula (maybe
    also prob())
    => tried it [see pnacopula()] but fails for complicated example in nac-experi.R
(*) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(*) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures

(MM) check new functions in cop_objects.R etc. for efficiency + see FIXME there
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) document polylog() and Stirling* functions
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
    Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
    dendrogram print()ing.
(MM) be compatible with package copula

(MM)  dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) get GIG generator to work
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
