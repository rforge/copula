## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(*) numerous FIXME and TODO in the code [already fixed some!]
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of
    numbers which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g.,
    for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.

(MH) Fisher information; how to? keep score functions?
     how to implement procedure based on log-likelihood only
(MH) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures

(*) "profile likelihood"-way of constructing confidence intervals
(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.
(MM) dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(MM) be compatible with package copula
