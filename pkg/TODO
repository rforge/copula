## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(MM) please "smooth" the help pages
(MM) include correct linebreaks afterwards (so that correct in manual)

(MM) Ist die Beschreibung des Resultat-Objektes in gnacopula() richtig?
(MM) in emde.Rd z.B. hat es oft doppelte Blanks als Leerzeichen. Warum?

(MM) shall we rename (rpd)Sibuya to (rpd)Sib as used in the text?
(MM) some examples changed. Can you automatically update/create nacopula-Ex.R?

(MM) shall we use "Rtrafo" or even "gRtrafo" instead of "Rosenblatt"? 
(MM) gnacopula: it would be nice to have another method switch for the two possible
    trafos "Hering and Hofert" and "Rosenblatt".
(MM) it always holds that psiDabsMC(0) != Inf; however, theoretically, this should
     be Inf for Gumbel and Joe. Shall we introduce a family-base switch to return
     the correct value at this boundary or shall we leave it as a flaw of MC that
     it is not possible to get this value correct?  

(MM) further questions: 
(1) I guess we can remove the FIXME on line 18 in cop_objects, can't we?
(2) FIXME line 442 in estimation.R: return an object?
(3) FIXME nacopula.R, line 203: onacopulaL() -- replacing nacStructure by nacList
    => sounds useful

(*) have to update Description; maybe: An R package for nested Archimedean copulas, providing a 
 procedure for computing function values, characteristics such as Kendall's
 tau and tail dependence coefficients, sampling algorithms for generating random variates, 
estimation procedures, and goodness-of-fit tests.

(*) inconsistent use of checks whether function arguments are in [0,1]^d or not:
some functions don't check, others do (e.g., dDiag)
=> remove checks everywhere due to performance? 
(*) svn mv opower to trafos
(*) GIG, opC in demo [with extensive comments]
(MH) opC: estimation example in man-emle

(*) FIXME and TODO in the code
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of
    numbers which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g.,
    for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.

(*) GIG as proper object in extra file
(*) GIG, opC demos
(*) opC: estimation example in man-examples

(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.


## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) implement Khoudraji or Liebscher trafo incl. density etc.
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(MM) be compatible with package copula
