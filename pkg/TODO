## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(*) Fix FIXME's in ./demo/poly-demo.R => also concerns copJoe@dacopula
(MM) make polyG (and polyJ) more efficient! see FIXME's there
(MH) implement opower with *correct* log + correct density!! [currently wrong]
(*) user outer() instead of "one.t()"-like functions in all dacopula slots when n.MC > 0; see psiDabsMC for the method
(MH) implement 1st derivative of the log density w.r.t. theta
(MH) implement MC engine for Fisher information
(*) maybe use asymptotics for scaling the sums of Joe and Gumbel [instead of computing the max] => would increase performance [but probably not much since all the ingredients have to be computed anyway and max() is not too expensive - maybe make max independent of summation index k, so that it only has to be computed once?]
(*) put license-stuff in the beginning of *all* files? e.g., demo?
(*) switch() sometimes uses strings [s. polylog], sometimes unquoted strings [s. enacopula]... => inconsistency

(MH) fix opower density issues...
(MM, MH) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(*) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures
(MM, MH) numerous FIXME in the code
(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?
(MM) are the numerical issues for Kendall's tau for the GIG generator [see ./demo] solvable? see the plot of Kendall's tau there.

(*) replace several 1:.. by seq_len(..)
(MM) check new functions in cop_objects.R etc. for efficiency + see FIXME there
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) document polylog() and Stirling* functions
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.

(MM)  dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...
      --> ~/R/MM/Pkg-ex/nacopula/dstable-problem.R

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
