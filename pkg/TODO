## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(*) numerous FIXME and TODO in the code [already fixed some!]
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of
    numbers which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g.,
    for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.
(*) make paraOptInterval to work with both long and short names of families

(MH) Fisher information; how to? keep score functions?
(MH) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures;
     fill notably
     	   man/K.Rd man/emde.Rd man/estim-misc.Rd


(*) GIG, opC in demo [with proper documentation]
(*) opC: estimation example in man-examples

(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.


## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(MM) be compatible with package copula
