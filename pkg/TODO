## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(MM) make polyG (and polyJ) more efficient! see FIXME's there
=> e.g., "pois" [default method] for Gumbel be improved
(*) does psiDabs for Gumbel with default "pois" work? check with plots!
    or all.equal dacopula() & dacopulag() for all methods & families
(*) does Gumbel MLE work for tau > 0.6?

(*) how to evaluate dJoe? maple can do it, why can't we?
=> this would ...
   (1) ... lead to a simpler method for dacopula and psiDabs for Gumbel
   (2) ... lead to a simple method for dacopula and psiDabs for outer power families
   (3) ... would fix dV01 of Joe [= dJoe]
(*) implement opower with *correct* log + correct density!! [currently wrong]
(*) user outer() instead of "one.t()"-like functions in all dacopula slots when n.MC > 0; see psiDabsMC for the method
(*) implement 1st derivative of the log density w.r.t. theta
(*) implement MC engine for Fisher information
(*) maybe use asymptotics for scaling the sums of Joe and Gumbel [instead of computing the max] => would increase performance [but probably not much since all the ingredients have to be computed anyway and max() is not too expensive - maybe make max independent of summation index k, so that it only has to be computed once?]
(*) put license-stuff in the beginning of *all* files? e.g., demo?
(*) switch() sometimes uses strings [s. polylog], sometimes unquoted strings [s. enacopula]... inconsistency

(MM) use same *sophisticated* environment trick for opower as for the other families; maybe also rename cOP to C.?
(MH) fix opower density issues...
(MM, MH) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(MH) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures
(MM, MH) numerous FIXME in the code
(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?  
(MM) are the numerical issues for Kendall's tau for the GIG generator [see ./demo] solvable? see the plot of Kendall's tau there.

(*) replace several 1:.. by seq_len(..)
(MM) check new functions in cop_objects.R etc. for efficiency + see FIXME there
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) document polylog() and Stirling* functions
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.

(MM)  dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
