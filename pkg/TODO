## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(MM) please "smooth" the help pages
(MM) include correct linebreaks afterwards (so that correct in manual)

(MM) please make new example on emle.Rd nicer [fix problem with x-axis: show theta, theta hat], add title...
(MM) Ist die Beschreibung des Resultat-Objektes in gnacopula() richtig?

(MM) how to create string with double quotes in method. in gnacopula?

(MM) it always holds that psiDabsMC(0) != Inf; however, theoretically, this should
     be Inf for Gumbel and Joe. Shall we introduce a family-base switch to return
     the correct value at this boundary or shall we leave it as a flaw of MC that
     it is not possible to get this value correct?  

(MM) further questions: 
(1) I guess we can remove the FIXME on line 18 in cop_objects, can't we?
(2) FIXME line 442 in estimation.R: return an object?
(3) FIXME nacopula.R, line 203: onacopulaL() -- replacing nacStructure by nacList
    => sounds useful

(*) it would be good to have tryCatch.W.E in the package [call it tryCatchWE -- easier to type]
    Maybe one can also directly return a list with "value", "error", and "warning"?
    [So far, "value" can also contain the errors => a bit unhandy, but maybe the only "elegant" general solution]

(*) have to update Description; suggestion: An R package for working with nested Archimedean copulas. 
 In particular, providing a procedure for computing function values and cube volumes, characteristics such as Kendall's
 tau and tail dependence coefficients, efficient sampling algorithms, various
estimation procedures, and goodness-of-fit tests. The package also contains certain
interesting univariate distributions, e.g., the Sibuya distribution.

(*) inconsistent use of checks whether function arguments are in [0,1]^d or not:
some functions don't check, others do (e.g., dDiag)
=> remove checks everywhere due to performance? 

(*) FIXME and TODO in the code
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of
    numbers which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g.,
    for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.

(*) GIG as proper object in extra file
(*) GIG, opC demos [MH is working on it]
    => opC in emle example section?

(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.


## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) implement Khoudraji or Liebscher trafo incl. density etc.
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(MM) be compatible with package copula
(*) include pairwise estimators for nACs
