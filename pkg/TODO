## ==== major ====

(MM) there are still some .Rd files (e.g., estim-misc.Rd), which do not contain
     linebreaks in the paragraphs [just in the .Rd file -- pdf looks fine]. Can
     this create problems in the html [or any other] version?
(MM) is the FIXME in Sibuya.Rd (line 12) solvable?
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
     => FIXME nacopula.R, line 202: onacopulaL() -- replacing nacStructure by nacList
(MM) fix dDiag for Joe and: large theta & close to 1 [MH: the problem seems similar to Frank]

(*) fix the following problem:
cop <- onacopulaL("Frank", list(200, 1:2)); rnacopula(100, cop)
maybe use limit copulas also for other families (upper frechet bound)
(*) fix estimation problems [MH wrote a problem_finder]:
    1) AMH & d=5 [=> make fail-safe --- DONE{MM}
    2) Clayton, tau=0.75 [=> todo]
    3) Frank, tau=0.75 [=> todo]
(MH) document problem with Anderson-Darling test & empirical margins
(MH) implement Bruno's test statistic
(*) implement log-slot for all psiInv; also psi's?
(*) implement gnacopula with proper exp(log()) ... using log-slots of psiInv
(*) make paraOptInterval safer and document what users should do for "extreme" parameters

## ==== minor ====

(MM) add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of
    numbers which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g.,
    for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.
(*) it would be good to have tryCatch.W.E in the package [call it tryCatchWE -- easier to type]
    Maybe one can also directly return a list with "value", "error", and "warning"?
    [So far, "value" can also contain the errors => a bit unhandy, but maybe the only "elegant" general solution]

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) implement Khoudraji or Liebscher trafo incl. density etc.
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
(*) include pairwise estimators for nACs
(*) FIXME in enacopula (in estimation.R): return an object?
(*) can we create a function for the GIG generator similar to opower()?
