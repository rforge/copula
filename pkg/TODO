## ==== TODO ====

## ==== major ====

(MM) please "smooth" the help pages
(MM) include correct linebreaks afterwards (so that correct in manual)
(MM) please make new example on emle.Rd nicer [fix problem with x-axis: show theta, theta hat], add title...
(MM) how to create string with double quotes? is currently buggy in gnacopula()?
(MM) FIXME in enacopula (in estimation.R): return an object?
(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
     => FIXME nacopula.R, line 203: onacopulaL() -- replacing nacStructure by nacList

(*) check all FIXME and TODO in the code
(*) fix estimation problems:
    1) AMH & d=5
    2) Clayton, tau=0.75
    3) Frank, tau=0.75

(MH) psiDabs-slots: fang' limit ab fuer t=0
(MH) GIG as proper object in extra file
(MH) GIG, opC demos [MH is working on it]
    => opC in emle example section?

## ==== minor ====

(*) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
    Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
    dendrogram print()ing.
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of
    numbers which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g.,
    for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.
(*) it would be good to have tryCatch.W.E in the package [call it tryCatchWE -- easier to type]
    Maybe one can also directly return a list with "value", "error", and "warning"?
    [So far, "value" can also contain the errors => a bit unhandy, but maybe the only "elegant" general solution]

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) implement Khoudraji or Liebscher trafo incl. density etc.
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
(*) include pairwise estimators for nACs
