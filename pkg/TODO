(*) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(*) get GIG generator to work
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) make pnacopula applicable to a matrix to be consistent with dnacopula (maybe
    also prob())


(MM) check new functions in cop_objects.R for efficiency + see FIXME there
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) document polylog() and Stirling* functions
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
    Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
    dendrogram print()ing.
(MM) be compatible with package copula

(*) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures
