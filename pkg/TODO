## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(MM) make polyG (and polyJ) more efficient! see FIXME's there
=> e.g., "pois" [default method] for Gumbel be improved
(*) does psiDabs for Gumbel with default "pois" work? check with plots!
(*) does Gumbel MLE work for tau > 0.6?
(MM) polylog still uses log(polynEval) instead of a "true" log-slot
(*) how to evaluate dJoe? maple can do it, why can't we?
=> this would ...
   (1) ... lead to a simpler method for dacopula and psiDabs for Gumbel
   (2) ... lead to a simple method for dacopula and psiDabs for outer power families
   (3) ... would fix dV01 of Joe [= dJoe]
(*) implement opower with *correct* log + correct density!! [currently wrong]

(*) implement 1st derivative of the log density w.r.t. theta
(*) implement MC engine for Fisher information
(*) maybe use asymptotics for scaling the sums of Joe and Gumbel [instead of computing the max] => would increase performance [but probably not much since all the ingredients have to be computed anyway and max() is not too expensive - maybe make max independent of summation index k, so that it only has to be computed once?]
(*) put license-stuff in the beginning of *all* files? e.g., demo?

(MM) use same *sophisticated* environment trick for opower as for the other families; maybe also rename cOP to C.?

(MM, MH) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(MH) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures
(MM, MH) numerous FIXME in the code
(MH) provide GIG and opC generator as demo...

(*) replace several 1:.. by seq_len(..)
(MM) check new functions in cop_objects.R etc. for efficiency + see FIXME there
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) document polylog() and Stirling* functions
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.

(MM)  dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...
      --> ~/R/MM/Pkg-ex/nacopula/dstable-problem.R

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
