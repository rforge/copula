## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(*) implement forward difference for computing dsumSibuya
(*) user outer() instead of "one.t()"-like functions in all dacopula slots when n.MC > 0; see psiDabsMC for the method
(MH) implement 1st derivative of the log density w.r.t. theta
(MH) implement MC engine for Fisher information

(MM, MH) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(*) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures

(MM, MH) numerous FIXME in the code
(MM) are the numerical issues for Kendall's tau for the GIG generator [see ./demo] solvable? see the plot of Kendall's tau there.
(MM) can we create a function for the GIG generator [see ./demo] similar to opower()?

(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.
(MM)  dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
