## ==== TODO ====

## ==== major ====

(MM) fix check [for Marius to work => build => brutus => tests]
(MM) please "smooth" the help pages [pdf]
(MM) include correct linebreaks afterwards (so that correct in manual)

(*) use "u" instead of "t" for all inverses [TeX-like and R functions]
(MM) please make new example on emle.Rd nicer [fix problem with x-axis: show theta, theta hat], add title...

(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
     => FIXME nacopula.R, line 203: onacopulaL() -- replacing nacStructure by nacList

(*) check all FIXME and TODO in the code
(*) fix estimation problems:
    1) AMH & d=5
    2) Clayton, tau=0.75
    3) Frank, tau=0.75

(MH) GIG demo
(*) FIXME opC-demo.R
(*) mention demos in estimation help file

## ==== minor ====

(*) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
    Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
    dendrogram print()ing.
(*) design a function that gets an outer nacopula and returns a matrix of
    numbers which correspond to the different sectors; this can be used, e.g.,
    for building a [default] color-matrix for splom2 or for estimation purposes etc.
(*) it would be good to have tryCatch.W.E in the package [call it tryCatchWE -- easier to type]
    Maybe one can also directly return a list with "value", "error", and "warning"?
    [So far, "value" can also contain the errors => a bit unhandy, but maybe the only "elegant" general solution]

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) implement Khoudraji or Liebscher trafo incl. density etc.
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
(*) include pairwise estimators for nACs
(*) FIXME in enacopula (in estimation.R): return an object?
(*) can we create a function for the GIG generator similar to opower()?
