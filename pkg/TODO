(*) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(*) get GIG generator to work
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) lgammacor shows underflow on executing the following snippet:

require(nacopula)
set.seed(1)
n <- 1000
theta0 <- copFrank@tauInv(0.05)
theta1 <- copFrank@tauInv(0.95)
V0 <- copFrank@V0(n, theta0)
V01 <- copFrank@V01(V0, theta0, theta1, rej = 0.1)

(MM) check new functions in cop_objects.R for efficiency + see FIXME there
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
    Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
    dendrogram print()ing.
(MM) be compatible with package copula
