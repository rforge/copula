## ==== features in next CRAN version ====

(MM) make polyG and polyJ more efficient! see FIXME's there
polyJ: scale with asymptotics [problem: do we really know what the max approximately is?] same applies for polyG
=> especially MLE for Gumbel is too slow
(MM) does Gumbel MLE work for tau > 0.6?
(MM) polylog still uses log(polynEval) instead of a "true" log-slot

(MH) is help file for "onacopula" correct? shouldn't "comps" be "comp"?

(MM, MH) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(MH) add (and fill) all help files for estimation and gof procedures
(MM, MH) numerous FIXME in the code
(MH) provide GIG generator as demo...

(*) replace several 1:.. by seq_len(..)
(MM) check new functions in cop_objects.R etc. for efficiency + see FIXME there
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) document polylog() and Stirling* functions
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
     Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
     dendrogram print()ing.

(MM)  dstable() from  fBasics is buggy ...
      --> ~/R/MM/Pkg-ex/nacopula/dstable-problem.R

## ==== long-term maybe ====

(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(*) be compatible with package copula
