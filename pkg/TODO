(*) implement color-feature in splom2 (now that i and j are included by Deepayan)
(*) allow families to have outer power parameters (outer power families)
(MM) Change onacopula() such that it works via onacopulaL() and hence
     can be used also from other functions.
(MM) maybe add an ASCII-plot for the hierarchical structure;
    Actually, define setAs("nacopula", "dendrogram", ....) and then use
    dendrogram print()ing.
(MM) be compatible with package copula
