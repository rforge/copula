## Copulas

Copulas are multivariate distribution functions with standard uniform univariate
margins. They are increasingly applied to modeling dependence among random
variables in probabilistic and statistical models arising in fields such as risk
management, actuarial science, insurance, finance, engineering, hydrology,
climatology, meteorology, to name a few. The relatively recent enthusiasm for
the use of copulas finds its origin in a representation theorem from 1959 due to
Abe Sklar. This result suggests to view a multivariate distribution function as
a coupling of its univariate margins by means of the underlying copula.
Important consequences are, for example, that more flexible multivariate
distributions can be constructed and that their statistical inference is
simplified, especially in high dimensions.

## About the book

The aim of this book is to introduce the main theoretical results about copulas
and to show how statistical modeling of multivariate continuous distributions
using copulas can be carried out in the
[R statistical environment](http://www.r-project.org) using the package
[copula](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copula) (among others). The book
targets statisticians, actuaries, risk managers, engineers and environmental
scientists alike, who would like to learn about the theory and practice of
copula modeling with R without an overwhelming amount of mathematics.

In the spirit of other monographs in the Springer
[Use R!](http://www.springer.com/series/6991) series, each chapter
combines key theoretical definitions or results with illustrations in R. The
book may also be used for teaching a course on copula modeling.


## List of features

* Offers a basic introduction to copulas and their main properties,
  along with the most important theoretical results.
* Introduces the most widely used copula classes, their corresponding sampling
  procedures, along with selected copula transformations that are important for
  practical purposes.
* Tackles the estimation of copulas from a parametric, semi-parametric and
  non-parametric perspective.
* Discusses graphical diagnostics, statistical tests and model selection.
* Addresses more advanced topics such as the handling of ties, time series and
  covariates (in a regression-like setting).
* Illustrates the presented concepts by stand-alone and reproducible R examples
  involving either synthetic or real data.
