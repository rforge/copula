Projects focusing on special application areas, statistical models, etc.

### Bioconductor: Bioinformatics with R
<http://www.bioconductor.org>

The broad goals of Bioconductor are to

-   provide access to a wide range of powerful statistical and graphical methods for the analysis of genomic data;
-   facilitate the integration of biological metadata in the analysis of experimental data: e.g. literature data from PubMed, annotation data from LocusLink;
-   allow the rapid development of extensible, scalable, and interoperable software;
-   promote high-quality and reproducible research;
-   provide training in computational and statistical methods for the analysis of genomic data.

### Rgeo: Spatial Statistics with R
<https://geodacenter.asu.edu/projects/rsp>

This collection of web pages is intended to be a supplement to the [Spatial](http://cran.r-project.org/view=Spatial) Task View on CRAN. It provides news, and guides to some of the resources for the analysis of spatial data using R, and other associated software.

### Robust Statistics with R

**Rmetrics: Financial Market Analysis with R**
<http://www.rmetrics.org>

Rmetrics is an open source solution for financial market analysis and valuation of financial instruments.

## Computational Infrastructure

Projects focusing on computational infrastructure, user interfaces, web-based services, etc.

### Omegahat: Distributed Statistical Computing
<http://www.omegahat.org>

Omega is a joint project with the goal of providing a variety of open-source software for statistical applications. The Omega project began with discussions among designers responsible for three current statistical languages (S, R, and Lisp-Stat), with the idea of working together on new directions with special emphasis on web-based software, Java, the Java virtual machine, and distributed computing. Omega encourages participation by anyone wanting to extend computing capabilities in one of the existing languages, to those interested in distributed or web-based statistical software, and to those interested in the design of new statistical languages.

### Graphical User Interfaces for R
<http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/>

This web page gives an overview over several projects that develop or offer the opportunity to develop graphical user interfaces for R. A Special Interest Group mailing list (R-SIG-GUI) exists also to freely discuss concerned issues.

### ESS: Emacs speaks Statistics
<http://ess.R-project.org/>

An Emacs-Lisp interface to interactive statistical programming and data analysis languages, including: S dialects (such as R), LispStat dialects and SAS.

### R for Mediawiki 
<http://mars.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/mediawiki/sk/index.php/R_Extension_for_MediaWiki>

allows to run R programs and display results (graphics, text) within [Mediawiki](http://www.mediawiki.org), the software behind [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) and other wiki projects.

### PowerShell R Interop Cmdlet
<http://powershellrinterop.codeplex.com>

A [PowerShell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx) Cmdlet providing smooth integration of R via the [R-(D)COM Server](http://www.sciviews.org/_rgui/projects/RDcom.html) into the PowerShell environment. Data can be piped from other PowerShell Cmdlets into R. Results from R can be piped into PowerShell Cmdlets. As R-(D)COM supports invocation of functions generating graphical output, Powershell 2 Interop Cmdlet can be used to easily create plots.

### TANGO/ALGENCAN
<http://www.ime.usp.br/~egbirgin/tango/>

Fortran code for the Augmented Lagrangian method for nonlinear programming problems, with interfaces to AMPL, C/C++, CUTEr, Matlab, Python, Octave and R.

## Misc

* [Statlib S Archive](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/S/): A rich source of useful 
  code, as most S code runs under R.

* [Dataverse Network Project](http://thedata.org/): DVN increases scholarly 
  recognition and distributed control for authors, journals, and others who 
  make data available, and facilitates data access and analysis for researchers
  via web software, data citation standards, and statistical methods.
