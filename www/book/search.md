For hardware reasons (disk space, CPU performance) there is currently no search facility at the R master webserver itself. However, due to the very active R user community (without which R would not be what it is today) there are other possibilities to search in R web pages and mail archives:

-   An [R site search](http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/search.html) is provided by Jonathan Baron at the University of Pennsylvania, United States. This engine lets you search help files, manuals, and mailing list archives.
-   [Gmane's R-lists](http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.lang.r.) mirrors several of our lists, with web, news, and RSS interfaces and search facilities.
-   [Rseek](http://www.rseek.org) is provided by Sasha Goodman at Stanford University. This engine lets you search several R-related sites and can easily be added to the toolbar of popular browsers.
-   The [Nabble R Forum](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/) is an innovative search engine for R messages. As it has been misused for spam injection, it is nowadays severely filtered. In addition, its gateway to R-help is sometimes not bidirectional, so we do **not** recommend it for posting (rather at most for browsing).

Thanks to all of them!

In addition, you can always use the advanced search feature of the [Google search engine](http://www.google.com/advanced_search):
