title: Mailing Lists
---


**Please** read the [instructions](#instructions) below and the [posting guide](posting-guide.html) *before* sending anything to any mailing list!

Thanks to Martin Maechler (and ETH Zurich), there are five general mailing lists devoted to *R*.

## R-announce

This list is for *major* announcements about the development of *R* and the availability of new code. It has a *low volume* (typically only a few messages a month) and everyone mildly interested should consider subscribing, but note that R-help gets everything from R-announce as well, so you don't need to subscribe to both of them.

Note that the list is *moderated* to be used for announcements mainly by the R Core Development Team. Use the [web interface](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-announce) for information, subscription, archives, etc.

## R-help

The ‘main’ *R* mailing list, for discussion about problems and solutions using *R*, announcements (not covered by ‘R-announce’ or ‘R-packages’, see above), about the availability of new functionality for *R* and documentation of *R*, comparison and compatibility with *S-plus*, and for the posting of nice examples and benchmarks. Do read the [posting guide](posting-guide.html) *before* sending anything!

This has become quite an active list with dozens of messages per day. An alternative is to subscribe and choose daily digests (in plain or MIME format). Use the [web interface](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help) for information, subscription, archives, etc.

## R-package-devel

is to get help about *package development* in R, i.e., to provide a forum for learning about the package development process,  a community of R package developers who can help each other solve problems, and reduce some of the burden on the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) maintainers. If you are having problems developing a package or passing R CMD check, this is the place to ask!

There may be some overlap of topics with the `R-devel` mailing list, as before the existence of `R-package-devel`, many package developers had used `R-devel` instead. Beware that *cross-posting* to both lists is generally considered as *impolite*.  For subscription and more, please read and use the [web interface](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-package-devel).

## R-devel

This list is intended for questions and discussion about code development in *R*.  Questions likely to prompt discussion unintelligible to non-programmers or topics that are too technical for R-help's audience should go to R-devel, *unless* they are specifically about problems in R package development where the `R-package-devel` list is appropriate, see also [the posting guide section](posting-guide.html#which_list).  The list is also for proposals of new functionality for *R*, and pre-testing of new versions.  It is meant particularly for those who maintain an active position in the development of *R*.

If you don't want to receive more than a daily message, you can subscribe and choose digests (in plain or MIME format). Use the [web interface](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-devel) for information, subscription, archives, etc.


## R-packages

This list is for *announcements* as well, usually on the availability of new or enhanced contributed packages (on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), typically).

Note that the list is *moderated*. However, CRAN package authors (and others, similarly qualified) can freely post. As with R-announce, all messages to `R-packages` are automatically forwarded to the main `R-help` mailing list; we still recommend to subscribe to R-packages if you read R-help only in digest form. Use the [web interface](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-packages) for information, subscription, archives, etc.


## Special Interest Groups

Additionally, there are several specific ***S**pecial **I**nterest **G**roup* (=: SIG) mailing lists; however do post to *only one* list at time ('SIG' or general one), cross-posting is considered to be impolite.

To satisfy geographic or regional (or subject) needs, some R users have formed *"R User Groups"* for which there are mailing lists. Information about most of these groups and their lists can be found on the [Revolution page](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html).

## Archives and Search Facilities

-   Browsable HTML versions of the mail archives can be found at the [web interface](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo).
-   Gmane also mirrors several of our lists, with web, news, and RSS interfaces and search facilities, see the index of [Gmane's mirrored R-lists](http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.lang.r.).
-   Have a look at CRAN's [search page](https://cran.R-project.org/search.html) for searchable versions of the mailing list archives.

## General Instructions

Note that you should configure your e-mail software in such a way as to send *only plain text*, i.e., **no HTML**. ‘html-ified’ messages are usually considerably longer (in bytes!) and harder to filter for spam or viruses. Many of these (e.g. ‘html-only’ ones) are currently spam-filtered or otherwise intercepted completely and without notice to the sender. For more details and instructions on turning off HTML for your e-mail software, see
 [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_email#Message_size) or
[there](https://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/notes/htmlmail.htm).
<!-- also http://www.harley.com/turn-off-html/ -->

Furthermore, most binary e-mail *attachments are not accepted*, i.e., they are removed from the posting completely. As an *exception*, we allow application/pdf, application/postscript, and image/png (and x-tar and gzip on R-devel). You can use text/plain as well, or simply paste text into your message instead.

Information about the list can be obtained by sending an email with ‘info’ as its contents to [r-help-request@R-project.org](mailto:r-help-request@R-project.org). Note that you *can* can subscribe and unsubscribe **by E-mail** (instead of the web interface), however to unsubscribe you currently need the mailing list password which you get when subscribing and in a monthly reminder.

To send a message to everyone on the r-help mailing list, send email to <r-help@R-project.org>.  Do please create a new email message when posting to the list rather than replying to a previous message and simply changing the subject line! This allows sensible *threading* in the mailing list archives (and many users e-mail readers). Subscription and posting to the other lists is done analogously, with ‘r-help’ replaced by ‘r-announce’ and ‘r-devel’, respectively. Note that the r-announce list is gatewayed into r-help, so you don't need to subscribe to both of them.

It is recommended that you send mail to r-help (or r-devel if appropriate) rather than only to the *R* developers (who are also subscribed to the list, of course). This may save them precious time they can use for constantly improving *R*, and will typically also result in much quicker feedback for yourself.

Of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful to have code which reliably reproduces the problem, see the [entry in the R FAQ](https://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R%20Bugs).
