title: Codes of Conduct at R Conferences
---

Conferences supported by the R Foundation must have a code of conduct in order to ensure an experience free from harassment for all participants. We encourage other R meetings not affiliated with the R Foundation to adopt the same policy.

A code of conduct serves two important purposes. Firstly, it sends a clear message to those outside the community that an R conference is a professional and comfortable working environment for all participants. Secondly, it provides a mechanism for reporting and monitoring any incidents of harassment that may occur.

We have decided not to require a particular formulation for the code of conduct, but suggest that conference organizers use the model of the [useR! 2015 conference](http://user2015.math.aau.dk/behaviouR). This will allow the code to be adapted to local circumstances and to evolve in the future. Conference organizers should ensure that any sanctions laid out in the code of conduct are legally and practically enforceable.
