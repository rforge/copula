## Errata

The following typographical errors were introduced by the production team of Springer.
The book was then published before we could give our final consent.

1) p. 150, 3 lines before Example 4.1.11: "Remark 3.1.2 (1)" should be "Remark
3.1.2 1)"

2) p. 170, line before the second code chunk: 'Also, Starting' should be 'Also,
starting' (so lowercase)

3) p. 259: misprint of the entry in the left column, near the bottom, associated with
page 68

4) p. 262: The example "Estimation of P via sample correlation vs Kendall’s
tau" shows up under Examples of Chapter 2 instead of 4.
