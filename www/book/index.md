## Welcome to the book web page!

TODO: Include picture of the book cover here

In a nutshell, the aim of the book is to show how some of the main steps involved in the statistical modeling of continuous multivariate distributions using copulas can be carried out in the [R statistical environment](http://www.r-project.org) using, mostly, the [R package copula](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copula).

Although the book addresses most of the practical issues arising when
modeling multivariate data with copulas, it only covers a modest part
of the field. In particular, important aspects such as dynamic copula
models, vine copulas or the use of copulas for discontinuous data are
not dealt with. This is partly due to a selection bias: Concepts that
are not implemented in the [R package
copula](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copula) at the time of
writing are not presented in the book. Many of these more specialized
notions are, however, available in other \R\ packages. For an
up-to-date description of the functionalities of other packages
dealing with copulas, see, for example, the [CRAN View
"Distributions"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html).

As the [R statistical environment](http://www.r-project.org), and most
free software, the [R package
copula](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copula) comes with no
warranty. It is distributed with the hope that it can be useful to
others.
