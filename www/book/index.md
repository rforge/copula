## Welcome to the R copula book web page

<!-- TODO: Include picture of the book cover here -->
<!-- TODO: Include link to Springer + where to buy book -->

In a nutshell, the aim of the book is to show how some of the main steps
involved in the statistical modeling of continuous multivariate distributions
using copulas can be carried out in the
[R statistical environment](http://www.r-project.org) using, mostly, the
[R package copula](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copula).

The current stable version of the package can be found on
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=copula) and the latest development version
can be found on [R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/copula/).

## Disclaimer

Although the book addresses most of the practical issues arising from modeling
multivariate data with copulas, it only covers a modest part of the field. In
particular, important aspects such as dynamic copula models, vine copulas or the
use of copulas for discontinuous data are not dealt with. This is partly due to
a selection bias: Concepts that are not implemented in the
[R package copula](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copula)
are not part of the book. Many of these more specialized notions
are, however, available in other R packages. For an up-to-date description of
the functionalities of other packages dealing with copulas, see, for example,
the
[CRAN View "Distributions"](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Distributions.html).

As the [R statistical environment](http://www.r-project.org), and most free
software, the [R package copula](https://cran.r-project.org/package=copula)
comes with no warranty. It is distributed with the hope that it can be useful to
others.
